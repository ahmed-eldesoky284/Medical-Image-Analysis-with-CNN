# Medical Image Analysis with CNNs

This repository contains code for analyzing medical images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The code is designed to work with the Chest X-Ray Images dataset, but can be adapted for other medical image datasets as well.

# Requirements

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

# Getting Started

1 - Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone ttps://github.com/ahmed-eldesoky284/Medical-Image-Analysis-with-CNN.git
```
2 - Download the Chest X-Ray Images dataset from Kaggle: [Chest X-Ray Images dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

3 - Extract the dataset files and place them in the chest_xray directory.

## Usage
1 - **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ahmed-eldesoky284/NLP-Twitter-Disaster-Classifier.git
   cd NLP-Twitter-Disaster-Classifier
```

2 - **Install Dependencies:**
  Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using:
  ```
  pip install pandas nltk scikit-learn tensorflow
  ```
3 - Run the Jupyter Notebook:
  Open the provided Jupyter Notebook 
  (Medical Image Analysis with CNN.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and execute each cell sequentially. Make sure to have the CSV 
  file (chest_xray/test.csv) in the same directory.

4 - Interpret the Results:
   After running the notebook, observe the output to understand the data distribution, model training process, and evaluation results.

## File Structure
  `Medical Image Analysis with CNN.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model building,
  and evaluation.
  `chest_xray/test.csv`: CSV file containing the bank marketing dataset.
  README.md: This file providing instructions and information about the project.
